				•	CSS – to customize the design.
        
				•	media query – to make responsive. 
				
				•	React router – used to define multiple routes.
				
				•	React Bootstrap – to get a stunning and responsive design.
				
				•	Email JS – to communicate with the visitors with mailing about their queries.
				
				•	MDB React – to design the footer of the website.
				
				•	React icons – for adding social media links in the contact page.
