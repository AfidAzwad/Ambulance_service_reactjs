•	React scroll – to switch pages with scrolling in a landing page.
•	CSS – to customize the design.
•	media query – to make responsive. 
•	React router – used to define multiple routes.
•	React Bootstrap – to get a stunning and responsive design.
•	Email JS – to communicate with the visitors with mailing about their queries.
•	MDB React – to design the footer of the website.
